/// the user hasn't booked their initial consultation. "Remind me
/// tomorrow" explicitly snoozes it for a day (server-side); the plain
/// "x" close (from the parent V2BottomSheet's default dismissible
/// shell) does NOT suppress it — it'll be back next reload. dismissCount
/// (bumped by the generic dismiss endpoint, if anything still calls it)
/// still trips a one-time BOOKING_REMINDER_5X staff escalation at 5,
/// but that's just a signal to staff now — it no longer stops the popup
/// from resurfacing.
///
/// "Book now" deliberately does NOT call completePopup — it only
/// navigates to the booking flow. Tapping the button isn't "done", an
/// actual booked Appointment is; helper/popupEligibility.js's
/// evalBookInitialReminder retires this popup server-side once a real
/// Appointment exists. Completing it here on tap used to retire the
/// active row on the spot, which (since this popup's setEligible call
/// carries no `cycle` in its metadata) meant the very next dashboard
/// evaluate pass couldn't recognize the row as "already completed" and
/// just created a brand new eligible one — the popup reappeared
/// instantly after every "Book now" tap, in a tight complete → recreate
/// loop.
